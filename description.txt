This mod aims to fix a few grievances with summons and flesh out Summoner to be a fully developed class. This vision is of a summoner who has their hands full buffing and controlling minions and has little time for other weapons.

Includes 6 items:
Summoners' Association Card - Displays summoner-related information
Minion Control Rod - Teleport your minions, select an enemy or spawn a reticle as a target
Blood Talisman - Sacrifice your own abilities to buff your minions at the cursor
Minion Selection Book - Allows summoning any minion from the inventory
Minion Loadout Book - Allows summoning a set of minions from the inventory with one click
Automatic Minion Loadout Book - Upgraded Minion Loadout Book that summons a minion set automatically after respawn

Other additions:
Minion&Sentry Slots Info - Displays the amount of minions/sentries currently summoned out of the available slots on the right side of your screen, like similar informational accessories
Minion&Sentry Slots Icon - Displays the amount of minions/sentries currently summoned above your defense

Contains two configs: 'Server Config' contains settings related to the reticle from Minion Control Rod and Loadout Book speed, while 'Client Config' contains settings related to the UI and info icons

If you experience issues with Minion Control Rods' reticle feature, let us know on the homepage; You can continue using this mod by disabling the feature in the 'Server Config'
