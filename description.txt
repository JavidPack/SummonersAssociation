This mod aims to fix a few grievances with summons and flesh out Summoner to be a fully developed class. This vision is of a summoner who has their hands full buffing and controlling minions and has little time for other weapons.

Includes 6 items:

Summoners Association Card - Displays summoner-related information
Minion Control Rod - Teleport your minions, select an enemy or spawn a reticle as a target
Blood Talisman - Sacrifice your own abilities to buff your minions at the cursor
Minion Selection Book - Allows summoning any minion from the inventory
Minion History Book - Allows summoning a set of minions from the inventory with one click
Automatic Minion History Book - Upgraded Minion History Book that summons a minion set automatically after respawn

Contains two configs: 'Server Config' contains settings related to the reticle from Minion Control Rod, while 'Client Config' contains settings related to the UI

If you experience issues with Minion Control Rods' reticle feature, let us know on the homepage; You can continue using this mod by disabling the feature in the 'Server Config'

Changelog:
v0.4.5.2:
* Added used sentry slots icon above the used minion slots icon
* Spider Staff minions now count towards the Minion History Books correctly

v0.4.4.1:
* 'Persistency' in the 'Server Config', making it so the reticle, once spawned, never despawns
