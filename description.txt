This mod aims to fix a few grievances with summons and flesh out Summoner to be a fully developed class. This vision is of a summoner who has their hands full buffing and controlling minions and has little time for other weapons.

Includes 6 items:

Summoners Association Card
Minion Control Rod
Blood Talisman
Minion Selection Book - Allows summoning any minion from the inventory
Minion History Book - Allows summoning a set of minions from the inventory with one click
Automatic Minion History Book - Upgraded Minion History Book that summons a minion set automatically after respawn
