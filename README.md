# Description
Designed for summoners who want a pure summoner experience but don't want to be passive. Summoners' Association allows summoners to have a vested involvement in their minions, directly controlling and helping their minions fight for them. For this, it adds several items that enhance minion control and damage, and plenty quality-of-life improvements every summoner will appreciate. You can see the full rundown by visiting the linked pages above.

# Future Plans
Continue to improve the involved summoner gameplay style.
