This mod aims to fix a few grievances with summons and flesh out Summoner to be a fully developed class. This vision is of a summoner who has their hands full buffing and controlling minions and has little time for other weapons.

[h1]Includes 6 items[/h1]
[b]Summoners' Association Card[/b] - Displays summoner-related information
[list]
[*] Shows the amount of minions summoned (out of the total available) under every minion buff
